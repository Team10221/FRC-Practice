# FRC Practice

This is Team 10221's FRC Practice repository. For every new iteration of robot code, create a new branch with the name of the year the robot code is for, such as `2024` or `2023`. If you intend to create an iteration of robot code for a year that already exists, add a number to the year for the iteration, such as `2024-2` or `2023-2`.
